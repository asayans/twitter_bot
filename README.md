# Yet another twitter bot
Tweets last pm.

This bot is written using Tweepy as the Twitter's API interface for Python.
Right now it checks every 30 seconds and only takes the very last pm . It then checks if the same text has been already tweeted and if not, it tweets it.

TODO:
1. Tweet every pm if not tweeted already.
2. Block spammers.
