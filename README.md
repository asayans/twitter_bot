# Yet another twitter bot
*Tweets last pm.*

This bot is written using [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) as the Twitter's API interface for Python.
This bot reads pms (text only), checks if the same text has already been tweeted and, if not, tweets it.
My initial idea was to block spammers but twitter kinda does that for you already so not adding that functionality.

**Feel free to suggest features!**

**Enjoy it!**
