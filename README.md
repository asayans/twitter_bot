# Yet another twitter bot
*Tweets last pm.*

This bot is written using [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) as the Twitter's API interface for Python.
Right now it checks every 30 seconds and only takes the very last pm . It then checks if the same text has been already tweeted and, if not, tweets it.

### TODO:
1. Tweet every pm if not tweeted already.
2. Block spammers.
